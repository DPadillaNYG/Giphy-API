2. Allow users to request additional gifs to be added to the page.

   - Each request should ADD 10 gifs to the page, NOT overwrite the existing gifs.

3. Include a 1-click download button for each gif, this should work across device types.

4. Allow users to add their favorite gifs to a `favorites` section.
   - This should persist even when they select or add a new topic.
   - If you are looking for a major challenge, look into making this section persist even when the page is reloaded(via localStorage or cookies).
